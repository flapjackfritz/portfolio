    'shortTitle': 'Why move to New Zealand?',
    'date': '9-16-2017',
    'author': 'Tommy Fritz',
    'entry': '<p>I have lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky for almost 9 years. Kelly, more than a decade.  We got married here in Bowling Green. We got our educations here, and we have made friends here. To be certain, there is a lot of reason to stay.  But it just isn\'t a good \'cultural fit\' for us.  More about what a cultural fit is later, though I\'m sure you already have imagery in your head about what it means.</p><p>We have never intended to stay. We got jobs, bought a house, and have put down roots in many ways. We have mused to each other about just dropping everything and leaving, going somewhere else. But we never did, because that would be really difficult. We have been planning this for awhile, the only new part is that we have settled on where we are going.</p><p>I have lived three places growing up, and made three sets of friends growing up. I have not kept up with any of them, as each move creates a new bubble of influence that a seemingly impenetrable separation between past and present lives. I moved from Wisconsin to Iowa in 4th grade, then from Iowa to Indiana in 11th. I know what it\'s like to move, I know the social rift it creates in your life, as well as the wellspring of opportunity it creates in the void. I know this next move is the right one, and it\'s the first one I\'m undertaking by my own volition.</p><p>Every place I have lived has had a distinctly different cultural vibe. People behave with subtle differences that are related to the things that are in their environment. Whether or not one fits in the culture depends on how broadly accepting the culture is, and if you participate in similar activities to those around you.  It can take a long time to find those people if there are not many of them, and how socially acceptable the activity is at large.  If you can find a church, you can quickly integrate into about anywhere in the midwest.  You have a social fit made for you.</p><p>There\'s very few activities in Kentucky we want to participate in. There\'s some light hiking and camping, but the kind of camping people do here is in an RV, generally leaving behind a lot of wasted and empty beer cans. The career prospects are even worse. The state is taking a nose dive into bigotry, and is working diligently to scrap the programs that help those living on scraps. What people value here does not broadly line up with what I value. It is not a good cultural fit.</p><p>I have been to New Zealand twice, once in 7th grade, and more recently on my 5 year anniversary with Kelly. The people there are friendly like the rural places I have grown up. But they value people beyond their social circles. People from New Zealand, or Kiwis as they affectionately refer to themselves, value people beyond their economic impact and their abilities. It is important that the environment has effective stewardship, and that opportunity is available to all, not just the most able. The way the MƒÅori people have taken the 21st century by the horns and pushed their way into it is unlike anything I\'ve known, it gives me hope for humanity.</p><p>I understand the challenges of the vast remoteness of the island nation. The things we have to give up to live there seem almost trivial at this stage. A higher cost of living doesn\'t seem like a big deal with a national healthcare system and strong consumer protections, and entertainment in the form of mountains, volcanoes, parks, and quality museums. Fewer choices and selection in retail and no amazon prime. Extreme remoteness from family is a gap that is bridged by technology.</p><p>Oh, did I mention I\'ll get two summers this year since it\'s in the southern hemisphere?</p><p>I\'m ready for sane politics and to participate in a society and culture where I can find my fit.</p>'

I chose to host it on AWS using a combination of services that renders it virtually free.  It uses ReactJS to display the content effectively and make updating it easier.  It's stored on S3 using CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, and Lambda to build and deploy it whenever I update and push to the github repository.",
